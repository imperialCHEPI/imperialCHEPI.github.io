# Welcome to Centre for Health Economics & Policy Innovation (CHEPI)

[CHEPI](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/business-school/faculty-research/research-centres/centre-health-economics-policy-innovation/) is built around a distinctive programme of research and teaching on health economics, policy and management.

The focus of the Centre's work is on the incentives that drive productivity, quality and innovation, both at the health system and organisational levels; on the incentives that drive health-related behaviours at the individual level; and on the factors that determine the success of health policies designed and implemented by governments.
